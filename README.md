# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification - ML Project

This project is a beginner-friendly machine learning solution that classifies iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” using logistic regression.

The dataset includes features like:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The goal is to train a model to predict the species of iris flowers based on these features.
